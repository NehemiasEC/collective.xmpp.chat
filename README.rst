Documentation for collective.xmpp.chat
======================================

**collective.chat.xmpp** provides instant messaging for Plone_. It uses the 
XMPP_ protocol and requires an XMPP server (such as ejabberd_) for the message handling.

It has a chat UI relatively similar to babble.client_'s, but very much
superior in design and performance.
